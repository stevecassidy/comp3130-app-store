      <h1>App Store Help</h1>
      <p>
        This app store is designed to help evaluation and review of the 
        mobile apps you have developed as part of COMP3130.   The goal is that you
        create an entry for your app and upload an APK build an a set of screenshots. 
        Other students can then review your entry, give you a rating and leave comments.
      </p>

      <p>This site is new and possibly buggy, please be patient with any problems or
        deficiencies that you find.  Report them to me, Steve.Cassidy@mq.edu.au.
      </p>

      <h2>How it Works</h2>

      <h3>Uploading Your App</h3>

      <p>Each student is given an account on the system, details will be emailed to
        you.   You can login to the site and create one app entry to describe your app.
        You will provide the details of your app and upload screenshots and an APK.
        You will provide any instructions that reviewers would need to review your
        app; for example, username/password if it is not possible to register an
        account.   
      </p>

      <h3>Reviewing an App</h3>

      <p>You will also see a number of apps from other students.   You can leave a review
        of these apps after evaluating them.    Your review should be based on looking at
        the description and screenshots of the app and ideally from downloading and
        running the APK on an Android simulator.
      </p>

      <p>Please make sure that you run the app only on a simulator: you shouldn't trust
        these apps with your personal device.  
      </p>

      <p>The easiest way to run an app on the simulator is to drag and drop the APK
        file on the simulator window.  This should install it on the device and 
        you should then be able to run it.
      </p>

      <p>Please report any problems running the app in your review comments.</p>

      <p>Your review and rating will be visible to the app author and the markers.</p>
